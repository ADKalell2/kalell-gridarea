                <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Axton is a new playable character in Borderlands 2, serving the role of the Commando class. He used to be a soldier in the Dahl corporation's military. However, his glory-seeking recklessness and constant disregard for orders earned him a scheduled execution. Despite being forced to leave his outfit (and his wife), Axton remains a gung-ho soldier. He fights his enemies and supports his teammates with equal enthusiasm.</p>

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-left">As an infant, Maya was identified as a Siren and given to the Order of the Impending Storm, the ruling order of monks on her homeworld of Athenas. She trained her Siren powers in secret until she reached adulthood, when the monks revealed her to the public as their goddess and savior. Irritated by the Order's short leash, she longed for adventure and expressed interest in traveling to Pandora to learn more about her Siren lineage. She eventually realized that the Order was using her as a threat to extort money and obedience from the people of Athenas. After Phaselocking and executing her handler Brother Sophis, she headed to Pandora to finally satisfy her curiosity about Sirens.</p>

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Zer0 is an assassin for hire. According to his wanted poster and his personal ECHO recordings, he performs both political assassinations and common hits. Following a particularly unsatisfying assassination where the target fails to fight back, despite being encouraged by Zer0 to do so, the assassin starts to look for a more challenging environment. He travels to Pandora after hearing of the Vault from a bartender, deeming the hunt as worthy of his skills.</p>
